      Version Control has many benefits: never lose code, ability to revert back to older code, work on multiple versions of product, compare code, prove that one works or one is broken, track team's work and time completed each file.

      Git tracks these changes on multiple branches within GitHub and in the git log.  The git log shows when a commit was added, commit #, and the message tied to each commit.  
    </p>
      GitHub is free as long as code is public.  Most websites a user can view the code by the inspect function to see the content so having it public is not a big deal.  GitHub is also the most popular VC on the market.
