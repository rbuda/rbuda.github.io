#To create a GitHub repository, after you've created a profile you want to hit the + symbol and select 'New Repository'.  Once this is created you'll want to copy the link next to HTTPS after new file and find file.  You then want to open up your computer's terminal and create a new file with the cmd mkdir <file-name>.  Type the following cmds:
cd <file-name>
git init
git clone <cut and paste URL>

#Open Source means that your project on GitHub will most likely be public allowing anyone to look at your code.  They can request to make changes as well.

#I think it is good considering one can always see the code you used on a website anyways by doing an inspect and looking at the elements.  

#Not having a license means you, by default, are subject to copyright laws.  No one else would be able to use your code and you'd have to seek legal counsel if you wanted to make your own.

#Making sure the origin is correct and getting my files to actually show up on GitHub has been a struggle.  Still working on an aha moment from the standpoint of having this be second nature.
