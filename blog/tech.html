            <h1>How Did Internet Start?</h1>
            <p>So who invented the internet?  Many people have made bazillions off the internet but who is its' Edison?  The internet we know today, was in the making for around 40 years.  ARPANET started in the 1960's and was originally funded by the US Department of Defense.  ARPANET's goal was to link mainframes so scientists could share computer power.  These mainframes could compute basically one task at a time.  When these mainframes were linked with time-sharing they could process several tasks at once.  Once they were linked the need to make communications between them quicker and easier became apparent.  This is when many different companies & countries get involved.<p>   
            <p>A division of the National Physical Labratory in Britain intially failed their prior research and lost funding.  They did however come up with concept of a computer sending data to another but cutting up that data to be transmitted and then putting it back together once it reached its' destination - called packet switching.  CYCLADES in France linked computers with a direct connection versus gateway computers.  Not that scientific but they were the first to come up with the word internet (with a french accent).  So credit the French.<p>
            <p>All of these events happen in the 60's but it really isn't until 1975 that networks really begin communicating with each other. They're able to communicate with TCP/IP.  Ignore the acroynm and just know that this forms the communication of the internet by labeling packets of data so when they arrive at their destination they can be properly assembled.  So we're kind of coming up on the 50th anniversary of the internet if you believe 1975 is its' birthdate.<p>  
            <p>In the 1980's, Timothy Berners-Lee spent time with CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, trying to learn what the universe is made of.  These scientists were having a tough time keeping track of each others research and compiling it.  Tim used HTTP, HTML & URL's to an invent an interface making their browsing possible called the World Wide Web.  Time didn't invent the internet but the web.  It's also important to note that around this time in the 80's phone companies see the potential and start laying the ground work for fiber optic cables and connections.<p>
            <p>Berners Lee then creates his first website in 1991 in France while at CERN.  Emails had been around prior to this but the public really didn't know or use it until around 1995.<p>
            <p> I know you're saying "wait, wait, didn't Al Gore invent the internet?". No but he did significantly help it but pushing legislation through to encourage the spread of the internet.<p>
            <p>Humans love to communicate and that has set us apart on the species chain.  The internet is thus a natural progression of our species communicating.  So send an email and leave a comment on that YouTube video - it's in our genes!<p>
