            <h1>Diversity In Tech: Women</h1>
            <p>Google & Intel have been focusing on the lack of diversity within their companies for the last 2 years. Their public analysis of the diversity of their employees hasn't changed much over the last 2 years - 71% men and 60% white. Two years, no changes - so what are they trying to do now?</p>
            <p>All factors are being looked at. One may surprise you that attrition is a problem for these low-ranking diversity companies. Studies found that companies with low diversity had high turnover amoungst women and minorities. Attrition is a focus and has changed the way some are paying employees and benefits are structured.</p>
            <p>Some are trying more outside the box approaches. Google and NASA have pressured Disney to start adding female characters that find joy in programming as a hobby.  The makers of "Miles From Tomorrowland" have added characters that change the science stereotype into a more positive one for children. The goal being to get young girls to think about the possibilities of a career in these fields.</p>
            <p>Maybe even this is a bigger picture thing that companies are only part of the equation. Who do we blame when young adults don't turn out the way they should? Parents! Yes parents can be a scapegoat for why women don't get in tech jobs. Did you know in 1918 blue was considered a feminine shade? Girls are pressured to wear pink for the first years of childhood and only play with dolls. Many parents and studies have came out stating that these push young girls to certain roles and away from fields that boys identify with.</p>
