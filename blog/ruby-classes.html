            <h1>Ruby Classes</h1>
            <p>Ruby is an object-oriented programming language. Its' foundation is set on objects with classes and methods and variables within these classes.  What are classes? To dive into this more let's say you wanted to create a class of football players and wanted to store for each player their position, number & team.  You could do so like this:<p><pre><code>class FootballPlayers
   def initialize(name, position, number, team)
      @name = name
      @position = position
      @number = number
      @team = team
   end
end</code></pre>
            <p>We've told the class to store our arguments into instance variables.  These instance variables are always going to start with the @ sign and be able to be accessed throughout the class.  Normal variables are only able to be accessed within their method so this gives us more flexibility with instance variables.  Let's add some methods:<p><pre><code>class FootballPlayers
   def initialize(name, position, number, team)
      @name = name
      @position = position
      @number = number
      @team = team
   end

   def number
      puts "{@number} is my favorite!"
   end

   def profile
      puts "#{@name} belongs on the #{team} as their #{position}!"
   end   
end
</code></pre>
            <p>This is similar to the ruby methods we've seen thus far.  This allows us to create multiple instances of classes.  Now we can send a player profile to the class to be stored in that instance.<p><pre><code>manning = FootballPlayers.new("Peyton Manning", "QB", 18, "Broncons")</code></pre><p>What we'll get is:<p><pre><code>=>"18 is my favorite!"
=>"Peyton Manning belongs on the Broncos as their QB!"
            </code></pre>
            <p>This allows us to call the manning FootballPlayers class later to see the instance variables we've stored for manning.  Hope this helps!</p>
